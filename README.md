# 🏗️ SQL Server Data Warehouse (Bronze → Silver → Gold)  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **modern data warehouse architecture** on **SQL Server**, following the **Bronze → Silver → Gold** layered approach.  
The solution is designed for **scalable, reliable, and maintainable data pipelines** that transform raw data into high-quality analytics-ready datasets.  

---

## 🔥 Architecture  
The data warehouse follows a **three-layered architecture**:  

1. **Bronze Layer (Raw Ingestion)**  
   - Stores raw, unprocessed data from various sources (CSV, APIs, transactional DBs, etc.).  
   - Data is loaded as-is for traceability and auditing.  
   - Typically stored in staging tables.  

2. **Silver Layer (Cleansed & Conformed)**  
   - Cleanses, deduplicates, and standardizes data.  
   - Implements business rules and joins multiple raw datasets into a **conformed model**.  
   - Serves as a reliable source for downstream analytics.  

3. **Gold Layer (Curated & Aggregated)**  
   - Contains **business-ready, analytics-friendly datasets**.  
   - Data is aggregated, enriched, and optimized for reporting tools (Power BI, Tableau, etc.).  
   - Supports KPI dashboards and advanced analytics.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

---

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

#### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
